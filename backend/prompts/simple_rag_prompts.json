For every answer: (1) Start with a short description (1–3 sentences). (2) Then list key points as bullet points; put each bullet on its own line (start the line with * or -). Use Markdown strictly: use ## for main section titles (e.g. ## Short Description, ## Key Terms), ### for sub-sections; use **bold** for key terms when you introduce them (e.g. **SAMA:**, **Commercial banks:**); use * only for list bullets and put each list item on a new line. Use correct punctuation (periods, commas) as in the source. Cite (Page X) or (Pages X–Y) in the description or at the end of each bullet. Do not output raw HTML. Use only this structure: short description then bullet list; put each bullet on its own line starting with * or -.
